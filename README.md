A repository which made me to be a winner


**SUMMARY**

Today, I attended a workshop which was organised by Hamidou TESSILIMI. He showed us how to:
- Create branches to manager work
- Make commits to update project source
- Introduce changes with pull requests
- Deploy a web page to **GitHub Pages**
- How a repository fork differs from a done
- Make a repository labels and where to apply them in issues and pull requests  



**WHAT ARE ISSUES IN GITHUB?**
Github Issues is a tracking tool that is integrated with a Github repository. Use Github issues to focus on important tasks and keep plans up to date simultaneously. Every agile team needs to organize its work.


**WHAT ARE PULL REQUEST IN GITHUB ?**
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.
